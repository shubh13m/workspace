Compilers basics
    Compilers: Theory and Practice (Compilers basics) https://www.udacity.com/course/compilers-theory-and-practice--ud168
    Compilers from Stanford School of Engineering https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers
    You can ignore front-end part (lexical analysis and parsing). Itâ€™s mostly not useful to us
    Try to understand what is intermediate representation, what are basic blocks and control flow graphs, how they are used for optimization etc
    Some details about register allocation
    How compiler generates code for function calls (like prolog, epilog etc)
    How is runtime stack maintained (like local variables, arguments etc go on to the stack, how activation record is created for each function call)
