## Basic Programming 
### Fundamentals.
* draw flowchart.
* wirte pseudocode for algorithm.                                   

## Drawing Patterns
* Split problem into parts.
* Find the formula for columns for each part.
* Write for loop for each part.

## Array.
Do not create dynamic array using user input.
always pass size of array in function parameter.

## Vector.
* Dynamic Array. #include<vector>
* vector<int> v{10,20,30};
* vector<int> v(10,5);
* use to find unique.
