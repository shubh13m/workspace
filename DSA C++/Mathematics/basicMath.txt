No of digit in a number : 
    Using loop and division operator x = 123; and maintaining count;
                        x = x/10 till x becomes zero.
    using logarithmic solution : return floor(log10(n) +1)

Sum of AP :  n/2 (2a + (n-1)d)

Sum of GP : a (1-r^n)/(1-r)

Quadratic Eq :  D = b^2 -4ac ; x = -b+-D^1/2 /2a

Mean : average; MEdian arrange and find mid point ; Mode : no of occurance

Prime number : Only divisible by 1 ad itself: 2,3,5,7,11,13
            every prime number can be represented by 6n+1, 6n-1 except 2 and 3

LCM : least common multiples : write multiples and find least.
